# LoRA-SpamFilter

A project aimed at filtering spam messages in SMS with miniature language models and part-of-speech tagging techniques. Work with Gemma:7b

## Consequent

üïê Under the conditions of more than ten text messages and repeated 5 times, a single message will be responded to in seconds.  
üö¶ Achieved 100% accuracy for For English.  
üòä The Chinese recognition logic is still being fine-tuned, so stay tuned.

## install

1. Install 'ollama' on its [official page](https://ollama.com/download).
2. Download Gemma Full version with ollama:

```bash
ollama pull gemma:7b
```

3. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gloridust/LoRA-SpamFilter.git
```

4. Run and try it:

```
cd ./LoRA-SpamFilter
python start.py
```

Then you can input SMS to test it.

## Test

Run 'python ./test.py' can test and count the accuracy of results. The program will run the input SMS multiple times and count the results and determine the reasons for each time.

## API

I believe that 'start.py' is the best demo to show how to use 'spam_detector.py'. Just:

```Python
from spam_detector import detect_spam
is_spam,reason = detect_spam(sms_content)
```

'detect_spam' will return two things:

- is_spam: If it is spam?
- reason:Why?

Usually, in scenarios other than debugging, we only use the first parameter 'is_spam'. So you can use it like this:

```
is_spam, _ = detect_spam(sms_content)
```

Enjoy it!
